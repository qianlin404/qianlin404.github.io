I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu) at UMass Amherst. I am working with professor [Prashant Shenoy](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~shenoy/) in [Laboratory for Advanced Software Systems](http://lass.cs.umass.edu/people.html#). My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning, edge computing, and distributed systems, with a focus on building systems for ML inference applications and understanding them through modeling, analysis, and experimentation. 

I completed my Bachelor's degree with honors from [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu). I worked as an undergraduate researcher under the supervision of professor [Bhuvan Urgaonkar](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~buu1/index.html). My undergraduate research focuses on modeling and analyzing the Amazon spot market for improving the cost-efficacy of cloud applications.
