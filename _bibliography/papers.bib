abstract = {In order to keep the costs of operating in-memory storage on the public cloud low, we devise novel ideas and enabling modeling and optimization techniques for combining conventional Amazon EC2 instances with the cheaper spot and burstable instances. Whereas a naturally appealing way of using failure-prone spot instances is to selectively store unpopular ("cold") content, we show that a form of "hot-cold mixing" across regular and spot instances might be more cost-effective. To overcome performance degradation resulting from spot instance revocations, we employ a highly available passive backup using the recently emergent burstable instances. We show how the idiosyncratic resource allocations of burstable instances make them ideal candidates for such a backup. We implement all our ideas in an EC2-based memcached prototype. Using simulations and live experiments on our prototype, we show that (i) our hot-cold mixing, informed by our modeling of spot prices, helps improve cost savings by 50-80% compared to only using regular instances, and (ii) our burstable-based backup helps reduce performance degradation during spot revocation, e.g., the 95% latency during failure recovery improves by 25% compared to a backup based on regular instances.},

abstract = {Many cost-conscious public cloud workloads ("tenants") are turning to Amazon EC2's spot instances because, on average, these instances offer significantly lower prices (up to 10 times lower) than on-demand and reserved instances of comparable advertized resource capacities. To use spot instances effectively, a tenant must carefully weigh the lower costs of these instances against their poorer availability. Towards this, we empirically study four features of EC2 spot instance operation that a cost-conscious tenant may find useful to model. Using extensive evaluation based on both historical and current spot instance data, we show shortcomings in the state-of-the-art modeling of these features that we overcome. Our analysis reveals many novel properties of spot instance operation some of which offer predictive value while others do not. Using these insights, we design predictors for our features that offer a balance between computational efficiency (allowing for online resource procurement) and cost-efficacy. We explore "case studies" wherein we implement prototypes of dynamic spot instance procurement advised by our predictors for two types of workloads. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our approach achieves (i) comparable cost but much better performance (fewer bid failures) for a latency-sensitive in-memory Memcached cache, and (ii) an additional 18% cost-savings with comparable (if not better than) performance for a delay-tolerant batch workload.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
